# Eclipse_boot_utils

So I'm a lazy guy and I wanted Eclipse at school to load automaticly using the workspace on my portable HDD. Its a fairly basic thing but I'm working on making the code look way nicer and the ability to add more than one workspace location so you can chose the workspace with a name that you give it.

Right now it works by getting the drive letter of where it is ran from then adding that drive letter to the path in the config file. So the paths it can acces can only be on the same drive that it is located in.

Also I am aware that the methode I use to check if the folder exist doesn't work, thats the first thing I need to fix.
